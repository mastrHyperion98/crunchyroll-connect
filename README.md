# crunchyroll-connect

Crunchyroll-connect is a python library used to connect, communicate and fetch streaming data from api.crunchyroll.com. This library enables developers to 
develop their own Crunchyroll Application alternative with more robust and flexible features. 

Note: This repository may stop working at any time as Crunchyroll has rolled out a new API and there is not telling when they may shutdown the old one. Atm their are still some legacy software that crunchyroll manages that still use the old api. For example, the Windows App.

# Features

* Search crunchyroll API by query
* Filter Crunchyroll catalog by genres, seasons (ex fall 2020), popularity, release dates, prefixes, etc
* Get a list of all the collections related to a series. (For example, each season of SAO is a different collection) 
* Easy to use, self managed package that handles the safe storage of data locally used by application. 
* Fetch and return stream data that can be used by external/custom media players

# Implementation Requirements
* FFmpeg(ffplayer --> https://matham.github.io/ffpyplayer/player.html) recommended for HLS episodes. 
* In theory, VLC also supports HLS, but i've had no luck getting it to properly read the stream. 


# Important Reference Works

* https://github.com/CloudMax94/crunchyroll-api/wiki
* https://github.com/BeeeQueue/yuna

Both of the above repositories were extremely important to help me understand how the crunchyroll api functions.
